# Minecraft Bedrock Edition Skinpack Compiler

Tired of manually using IObit unlocker manually everytime you want to put custom skins with capes? or even installing the bypass

<sub>Download from releases on the right!</sub> âž¨

here is the answer ðŸ˜Ž, this requires nothing other than to get your cape and skin textures, apply them to the correct folders and run the program. 
everything else is automated
