# Minecraft Bedrock Edition Skinpack Compiler

Tired of manually using IObit unlocker manually everytime you want to put custom skins with capes? or even installing the bypass

here is the answer ðŸ˜Ž, this requires nothing other than to get your cape and skin textures, apply them to the correct folders and run the program. 
everything else is automated

- **ADDED ZOMBIE ARMS** (note this is limited to 1 slim and 1 normal skin since it uses the defaults as a base, no way around this, otherwise servers like hive will set you to a random default skin
